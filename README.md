# mmap-io - Node.js addon for memory mapping files (mid-2024 version)

## Quick info

- Long story short: with this addon you can increase performance of your file interactions by memory mapping files, 
you are "project" some file to RAM and push data to RAM without any interactions with hdd/ssd subsystem -- this module will
facilitate reliable syncing between RAM-file and disk-file. [mmap(2)](https://linux.die.net/man/2/mmap) / [madvise(2)](https://linux.die.net/man/2/madvise) 
/ [msync(3)](https://linux.die.net/man/3/msync) / [mincore(2)](https://linux.die.net/man/2/mincore) for Node.js
- It's a fork of mmap-io ([ozra/mmap-io](https://github.com/ozra/mmap-io) -> [Widdershin/mmap-io](https://github.com/Widdershin/mmap-io))
- **mmap-io** is written in C++17 and TypeScript, when you're installing it in your project, you're automatically getting 
a precompiled binary (.node-file) for your platform from Downloads section of this project. 
Otherwise it requires a C++17 compiler and Python 3.12+ on your machine to build.
- **mmap-io** is tested on 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.
- **mmap-io** has built binaries for Windows x86_64, Linux x86_64, Mac x86_64, Mac ARM.
- Potential use cases: working with big files (like highly volatile game map files), pushing data to cache files, video/audio-processing, messaging mechanics for inter-process communication.

## Quick TS example

```typescript
    import fs from "fs"
    import mmap from "@riaskov/mmap-io"
    
    const file = fs.openSync("/home/ubuntu/some-file-here", "r+")
    const buf = mmap.map(fs.fstatSync(file).size, mmap.PROT_WRITE, mmap.MAP_SHARED, file)
    mmap.advise(buf, mmap.MADV_RANDOM)
    // Now you can work with "buf" as with a regular Buffer object.
    // All your changes will be synced with the file "some-file-here" on disk.
    // For example, add number 1024 at 0 position of buffer:
    // buf.writeUInt32LE(1024, 0)

```
# News and Updates

### 2024-07-21: version 1.5.0
- Use SharedArrayBuffer as a base primitive instead of Buffer

### 2024-05-12: version 1.4.3
- Add support for Node 22

# Install
Use npm or git.

```
npm install @riaskov/mmap-io
```

```
git clone https://github.com/ARyaskov/mmap-io.git
cd mmap-io
npm install
```


# Some code examples

```typescript
// Following code is plastic fruit; not t[ae]sted...

import mmap from 'mmap-io';
import fs from 'fs';

const someFile = "./foo.bar";

const fd = fs.openSync(someFile, "r");
const fd_w = fs.openSync(someFile, "r+");

// In the following comments:
// - `[blah]` denotes optional argument
// - `foo = x` denotes default value for argument

const size = fs.fstatSync(fd).size;
const rx_prot = mmap.PROT_READ | mmap.PROT_EXEC;
const priv = mmap.MAP_SHARED;

// map(size, protection, privacy, fd [, offset = 0 [, advise = 0]]): Buffer
const buffer = mmap.map(size, rx_prot, priv, fd);
const buffer2 = mmap.map(size, mmap.PROT_READ, priv, fd, 0, mmap.MADV_SEQUENTIAL);
const w_buffer = mmap.map(size, mmap.PROT_WRITE, priv, fd_w);

// advise(buffer, advise): void
// advise(buffer, offset, length, advise): void
mmap.advise(w_buffer, mmap.MADV_RANDOM);

// sync(buffer): void
// sync(buffer, offset, length): void
// sync(buffer, isBlockingSync[, doPageInvalidation = false]): void
// sync(buffer, offset = 0, length = buffer.length [, isBlockingSync = false [, doPageInvalidation = false]]): void

mmap.sync(w_buffer);
mmap.sync(w_buffer, true);
mmap.sync(w_buffer, 0, size);
mmap.sync(w_buffer, 0, size, true);
mmap.sync(w_buffer, 0, size, true, false);

// incore(buffer): [unmappedPages: number, mappedPages: number]
const core_stats = mmap.incore(buffer);

```

### Good to Know (TM)

- Mappings over 1 GiB is not supported.
- The mappings are automatically unmapped when the buffer is garbage collected.
- Write-mappings need the fd to be opened with "r+", or you'll get a permission error (13).
- If you make a read-only mapping and then ignorantly set a value in the buffer, all hell previously unknown to a JS'er breaks loose (segmentation fault).
It is possible to write some devilous code to intercept the SIGSEGV and throw an exception, but let's not do that!
- `Offset`, and in some cases `length` needs to be a multiple of mmap-io.PAGESIZE (which commonly is 4096)
- Huge pages are only supported for anonymous / private mappings (well, in Linux), so I didn't throw in flags for that since I found no use.
- As Ben Noordhuis previously has stated: Supplying hint for a fixed virtual memory address is kinda moot point in JS, so not supported.
- If documentation isn't clear, make an issue.
